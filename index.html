            The Art of War

        <p>
            To assert their power,<br>
            the empire was ruled over<br>
            the rebel,<br>
            confirming their ability to control.<br>
            Murder, sacrilege, and war by land and sea.<br>
            The scene is presumably<br>
            framed by national colors.<br>
            In the event of dispute,<br>
            bias can easily manipulate the message.

            Army recruiter beckoning,<br>
            “You can help!”<br>
            Men wanted for the Army<br>
            with free admission.<br>
            Protect your child, boys!<br>
            Give Because You Care,<br>
            your patriotism equals the cost.<br>
            Who follows?<br>
            A puppet of imperial portraiture,<br>
            he has offered himself,<br>
            became an avid supporter.<br>
            Is Innocent.<br>
            The years leading up to Civil War:<br>
            Cheerful volunteers.<br>
            Aloof expression.<br>
            An invasion,<br>
            Finally.

            The Night After the Battle<br>
            Came the face of God<br>
            after seeing Two soldiers<br>
            had been disabled,<br>
            facing each other<br>
            with a look of fear.<br>
            And red.<br>
            The Soldier's Vision,<br>
            Defeated.

            The reverse depicts a victory<br>
            to legitimize the sovereignty of rulers<br>
            by confirming their ability<br>
            to overcome all opposition.<br>
            Resentment of young men<br>
            served as a powerful arm.<br>
            The Brave Wife,<br>
            every mother sister wife and sweetheart<br>
            Making Propaganda,<br>
            Music and words<br>
            Flying out of an image.<br>
            “A festival of victory.”<br>
            No evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's a lot at stake.<br>
            Battles appear to be lunging toward us.<br>
            “Good bye, Dad, I'm off to fight.”<br>
            “I’m satisfied” said the dying hero,<br>
            Soldier shaking hands with God,<br>
            And expired in the moment of victory.
